To host this website locally, follow these steps

Clone this repository:

Install Jekyll:

`gem install bundler jekyll`

Navigate to website folder:

`cd mac-goodwin.com\mac-goodwin`

Launch Server:

Navigate to site in browser (at the following address by default - jekyll will tell you if this is different)
