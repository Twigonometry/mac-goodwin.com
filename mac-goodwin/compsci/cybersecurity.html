    <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
    <hr>

<p>Cybersecurity has interested me for a long time. I wanted to be a Penetration Tester as soon as I heard about the job; over time, my interests have evolved to include secure networking and cloud infrastructure, web application testing, online anonymity technology, information flow security, applying AI to Cybersecurity, and Cryptography</p>

<p>I also enjoy Cybersecurity Training and Education. I deliver regular lectures on a range of Cybersecurity topics as part of my role with <a href="https://shefesh.com">Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers</a> society (SESH), and have delivered technical training on Computer Networking to my colleagues as part of my <a href="/compsci#industry-year">Year in Industry</a>. I also enjoy spending time on Cybersecurity training platforms such as <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu">Hack the Box</a> and <a href="https://www.tryhackme.com/login">TryHackMe</a>, and have taken inspiration from these platforms when developing my own challenges, worksheets, and CTFs for SESH. Wherever I end up, I hope to be able to help educate and upskill people in Cyber</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<h4>CTF Tools</h4>

<p>I have built a number of custom scripts, collected in <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/CTF-Tools">one repository</a>. It contains a password cracker, a HTTP request repeater, and a number of scripts that I have used in CTFs and Hack the Box boxes</p>

<h4>Deserialisation Demo</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/Deserialisation-Demo">This code</a> demonstrates a simple PHP Deserialisation vulnerability, which I used during a <a href="https://shefesh.com/assets/wiki/Advanced%20Web%20Hacking%20-%20PDF.pdf">Web Application Hacking session</a> for SESH</p>

<h4>Year in Industry</h4>

<p>On my Year in Industry I have had the chance to work with web scraping technologies such as Beautiful Soup, do basic analysis of APK files in Ghidra, and build secure infrastructure in AWS. I have gained a number of skills assessing applications for potential vulnerabilities, and have learned a lot about secure development and networking on Unix based platforms, from proxies and SSL stripping tools to analysis with Burp Suite and Wireshark. I have assessed my own software for vulnerabilities, and helped with initial assessments for a number of other platforms</p>

<h3>How I Practice</h3>

<p>I am extremely interested in the Hack the Box platform, and have solved a number of boxes on the platform</p>

<script src="https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/205518"></script>

<p>Skills I have gained from the platform include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enumeration & Web Application testing tools such as Nmap, Gobuster, Wfuzz amd SQLMap; manual exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQLI</li>
    <li>Searching for and exploiting CVEs on websites using Searchsploit, Metasploit, and custom exploits</li>
    <li>Enumerating filesystems with Linpeas and Pspy, and exploiting custom code & Unix security misconfigurations</li>
    <li>Enumerating exposed Git repositories with tools such as Git Dumper, and finding exposed secrets in code bases, on boxes such as <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/298">Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/297">Academy</a></li>
    <li>Deserialisation Vulnerabilities - on <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/297">Academy</a>, <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/309">Tenet</a>, and <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/286">Time</a></li>
    <li>AWS Testing and Exploitation - on <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/283">Bucket</a></li>
    <li>Server-Side Template Injection - on <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/278">Doctor</a></li>
</ul>
