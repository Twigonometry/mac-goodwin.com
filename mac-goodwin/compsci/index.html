        <h3>My Degree</h3>

        <p>I'm currently studying MComp Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">University of Sheffield</a>, with an Industry Year Placement. I will be graduating in 2023</p>


        <p>The topics covered in my degree include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Engineering; we have had two modules, focusing on Ruby and RoR and learning to interact with real-world clients and elicit requirements</li>
            <li>Java Programming; learning efficient design patterns in large software projects, and the complexities of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm</li>
            <li>Algorithm Design & Complexity; covered complexity classes of basic algorithms in first year; covered various Automata and Formal Languages, and the details of more complex algorithms (from Graph Theory to Optimisation problems) in second year</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence & Big Data; covered the fundamentals of Artifical Intelligence, including 'GOFAI' and search trees, in first year; covered big data powered classification methods using PCA in second year. Practical implementations included Java Search and Python Classifiers with Numpy</li>
            <li>Web Technology; learned the basics of modern web design, and put these skills to the test with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails</li>
            <li>Robotics; we covered various aspects of Robotics, from programming simple robots using Java in first year, to using ROS and WeBots in second year to implement a pathfinding robot; we also covered various aspects of bioinspired robotics</li>
            <li>Functional Programmming; we learned the basics of Haskell and reproduced a working Enigma Machine and Bombe; I was extremely proud to achieve 99% overall in this module</li>
            <li>Formal Logic; we had a very enjoyable module on formal logic, exploring Propositional and Predicate Logic, SAT Search, and the basics of Model Checking. I loved this module, and I am keen to see how I can apply it to my interests in other areas, especially in research such as information flow modelling</li>
            <li>Devices & Networks; in first year we covered the basics of computer networking and low level hardware, including some Assembly Programming</li>
            <li>Throughout the degree we have covered lots of relevant mathematics, including Linear Algebra, Set Theory, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and the maths behind Cryptographic Algorithms such as RSA</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My academic interests include Cybersecurity research (such as Cryptography and <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/security">Advanced Systems</a>); Formal Logic and Verification (for example in Critical Systems); Artificial Intelligence and Agent-Based Modelling (for example, how AI and big data can be applied to cyber threat modelling and child protection). I also have an interest in efficient Algorithm Design, and love reading about elegant solutions to problems (like the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler Problems</a>)</p>

            <h4>Tools & Technologies</h4>

            <p>I am comfortable using the following tools, techniques, and programming paradigms</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Object-Oriented Programming with Java, especially Model-View-Controller and Model-Delegate patterns, and some experience with C#</li>
                <li>Functional Programming with Haskell, and applying this to <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/haskell-logic">formal logic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/Project-Euler">mathematical problems</a></li>
                <li>Extensive experience with Python programming, on both small and large scale projects; skills include Multiprocessing, Automated Website Interaction and Scraping with Beautiful Soup, and Numpy for data processing</li>
                <li>Experience with web-based languages such as HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and PHP; use of these languages in a web development context, and when assessing and exploiting web vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Experience with modern Model-View-Controller Web Frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django; confident use of templating languages such as Jekyll</li>
                <li>Confident use of both Windows and Unix-based development; comfortable with Command Line Interfaces, remote interaction with machines, and virtualisation technology</li>
                <li>Extensive use of Amazon Web Services, with projects built and hosted in AWS from scratch; skills include web hosting in EC2 and S3, storage solutions within RDS and S3, configuring secure networks with VPC, and automatic deployment of secure infrastructure with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>. I would be confident to quickly and securely deploy a solution in the Cloud using AWS</li>
                <li>Confident use of several Cybersecurity tools, especially for web application testing and Linux enumeration; comfortable use of Kali Linux, and able to build <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/CTF-Tools">custom scripts</a> for automating exploits</li>
                <li>As part of my work as an IT Support Administrator at <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/uk/">NCC Group</a> I gained experience with basic hardware maintenance and a multitude of IT management tools including HEAT, Active Directory, and IPAM</li>
                <li>Use of project and code management tools such as Git, Issues, and Kanban Boards; confident with project management and administration, and I enjoy a good spreadsheet (which I know is boring, but the rest of these techs have been fairly cool)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Interests</h4>

            <p>I am extremely interested in Cybersecurity and spend a large amount of time practising my skills on online platforms such as <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu">Hack the Box</a>. I also enjoy passing on my skills as Vice President of the <a href="https://shefesh.com">Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers Society</a> (SESH), where I present lectures and demos on Cybersecurity topics and help to build tools and CTFs for educational purposes</p>

            <p>I have a love of automation within Computer Science, and I'm always looking to improve productivity. I enjoy creating bash scripts and simple aliases to make my work faster, and creating scripts to easily replicate complex steps during Cybersecurity practice such as Hack the Box</p>

            <p>I enjoy web development, and have had experience with both front end and back end development. I enjoy making 'modular' websites using templating languages such as Jekyll, and have built several websites from scratch as part of my Year in Industry and personal projects, sometimes with a quick turnaround time. I have also had the opportunity to assess my own websites for cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and enjoy testing my projects</p>

            <p>I am interested in helping others learn Computer Science; I have found helping with SESH extremely rewarding, and even had a chance to help upskill members of my team during my Year in Industry by delivering technical training on Computer Networking</p>

            <p>I love polishing off and delivering a project; I have been lucky enough to present proof of concepts to international partners, and enjoy producing thorough and succinct technical documentation that can be understood by less technical colleagues</p>
            
            <p>I have a strong creative streak, and I love making things other people can use and enjoy - whether this is a website, a game, a tool, or an educational package. In my work I have developed good interpersonal skills and the ability to discuss software requirements with both technical and non-technical staff and clients, which has been invaluable. Most of all, I love the problem solving opportunities Computer Science presents</p>
