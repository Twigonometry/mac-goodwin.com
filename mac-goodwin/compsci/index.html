            <h4>Interests</h4>

            <p>I am extremely interested in Cybersecurity and spend a large amount of time practising my skills on online platforms such as <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu">Hack the Box</a>. I also enjoy passing on my skills as Vice President of the <a href="https://shefesh.com">Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers Society</a> (SESH), where I present lectures and demos on Cybersecurity topics and help to build tools and CTFs for educational purposes</p>

            <p>I have a love of automation within Computer Science, and I'm always looking to improve productivity. I enjoy creating bash scripts and simple aliases to make my work faster, and creating scripts to easily replicate complex steps during Cybersecurity practice such as Hack the Box</p>

            <p>I enjoy web development, and have had experience with both front end and back end development. I enjoy making 'modular' websites using templating languages such as Jekyll, and have built several websites from scratch as part of my Year in Industry and personal projects, sometimes with a quick turnaround time. I have also had the opportunity to assess my own websites for cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and enjoy testing my projects</p>

            <p>I am interested in helping others learn Computer Science; I have found helping with SESH extremely rewarding, and even had a chance to help upskill members of my team during my Year in Industry by delivering technical training on Computer Networking</p>

            <p>I love polishing off and delivering a project; I have been lucky enough to present proof of concepts to international partners, and enjoy producing thorough and succinct technical documentation that can be understood by less technical colleagues</p>
            
            <p>I have a strong creative streak, and I love making things other people can use and enjoy - whether this is a website, a game, a tool, or an educational package. In my work I have developed good interpersonal skills and the ability to discuss software requirements with both technical and non-technical staff and clients, which has been invaluable. Most of all, I love the problem solving opportunities Computer Science presents</p>

    <h3>Year in Industry Placement</h3>

    <p>I am extremely fortunate to be on a Year in Industry placement from July 2020 - August 2021</p>

    <p>This placement is in the public sector, working on a Cybersecurity focused innovation team. I work closely with technical and non-technical partners within my organisation, and have produced solutions for regional teams as well as presenting proof of concepts internationally</p>

    <p>We have been given the opportunity to drive our own projects and self-manage within our teams. I've worked with other interns on large scale team projects, building complex Web Scraping systems from the ground up, and have experienced agile methodologies and project planning</p>

    <p>My work focuses on innovating within our sector and examining Cybersecurity trends. I have produced solutions involving Web Scraping, Secure Networking and Infrastructure development, and productivity tools. I have deployed multiple web applications in several languages and frameworks to suit the needs of the project, and interacted with cloud storage solutions including RDS and S3</p>

    <p>We regularly work within AWS, and I have gained invaluable experience deploying projects in the cloud and managing infrastructure. Outside of programming, one of my largest projects has been to configure and deploy secure infrastructure to be used by all members of the team, using AWS CloudFormation. This taught me a lot about Networking and the benefits of automation</p>

    <p>I have also had the opportunity to learn a lot about the public sector, teamwork, and project management. I have even presented technical training packages to my colleagues, helping to upskill them in Computer Networking; this experience was a fantastic test of my knowledge, presentation skills, and ability to communicate effectively with staff from a wide range of backgrounds</p>
