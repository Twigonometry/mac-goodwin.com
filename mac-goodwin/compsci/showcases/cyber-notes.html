<h3>Cybersecurity Notes</h3>

<p>This repository compiles all of my public Cybersecurity Notes, from writeups to cheatsheets on a wide range of subjects</p>

<p>I plan to include detailed writeups of complex topics, resources for beginners, and proof of concepts for CVEs</p>

<p>The notes are designed to be highly linked and atomic, and easily searchable. They're built to be viewed in Obsidian, a markdown note-taking app</p>

<p>You can find the repository at <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/Cybersecurity-Notes">my GitHub page</a>, along with install instructions for Obsidian (which creates the sexy graph you see below)</p>
