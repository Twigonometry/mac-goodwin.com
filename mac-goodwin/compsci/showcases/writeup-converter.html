<h3>Writeup Converter</h3>

<p>This is a command-line tool for exporting a folder of markdown notes from Obsidian, and bringing any linked attachments along for the ride. Find the code <a href="http://www.github.com/Twigonometry/writeup-converter">here</a></p>

<p>At the time of writing this, there didn't seem to be an official way of doing this - so I built one!</p>

<p>I've used this tool to export my private Obsidian notes to my public repository of <a href="/compsci/showcases/cyber-notes.html">Cybersecurity Notes</a>, as well as formatting them to go on this website!</p>

<p>I learned a large number of useful skills when developing this tool:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using argparse to build an effective and consistent command-line tool</li>
    <li>Using regexes and capture groups to perform efficient text processing and formatting on large files</li>
    <li>Proper use of the python interactive shell to test my changes</li>
</ul>

<p>I also learned a lot about automation in general - namely, to consider whether it's actually worth scripting something or not... This one turned out to be useful just as a learning exercise, and will help me in the long run when my writeup output gets bigger - it will also hopefully be useful to other people. But it's worth evaluating how much time building a tool like this will save you!</p>
