        <h3>Hi, I'm Mac Goodwin</h3>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>I'm an MComp Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">University of Sheffield</a></p>
            <p>I'm especially interested in cybersecurity, machine learning, and the intersection between the two. Recently, I've also taken an interest in formal logic and how this can be applied to security and verification</p>
    	    <p>In the 2020-2021 academic year, I'll be lucky enough to be on a Year in Industry in a cybersecurity related field. While I'm away from Uni, I'll be working on various projects and helping to run <a href="https://shefesh.com/">Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers</a> society</p>

    <hr>
    <p>In my spare time I enjoy writing, running, scouting, and board and card games. I'll occasionally take part in a related competition (but I haven't won anything yet)</p>
    <p>I write mostly poetry, and some short stories. You can see my most recently published work <a href="https://theunpublishablezine.wordpress.com/2020/08/17/the-space-in-between-by-mac-goodwin/">here</a></p>

    <p>I built this website myself, coded in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. You can view the code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/mac-goodwin.com">here</a>, as well as my <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry?tab=repositories">other projects</a></p>
    <p>There are plenty more features still to come :)</p>
