        <h3>Hi, I'm Mac Goodwin</h3>
        <div class="text-block">
            <p>I'm an MComp Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">University of Sheffield</a></p>
            <p>I'm a driven and ambitious student who loves creating - whether it's software or learning resources</p>
            <p>I'm especially interested in cybersecurity, formal logic, and the intersection between the two. In the 2021-22 academic year I will be completing a Dissertation project in this field using Isabelle for modelling</p>
    	    <p>In the 2020-2021 academic year I completed a Year in Industry in public-sector Cybersecurity, and gained a lot of Software Engineering experience along the way</p>
            <p>In my spare time I run the <a href="https://shefesh.com">Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers society</a>. I love creating Cybersecurity learning material, and I am currently working towards my OSCP Certification</p>

    <hr>
    <p>In my spare time I enjoy writing, running, scouting, and board and card games. I'll occasionally take part in a related competition (I even <a href="/writing/hive-2020.html">won one</a> recently)</p>
    <p>I write mostly poetry, and some short stories. You can see my most recently published work <a href="https://www.greeninkpoetry.co.uk/poetry-submissions-all/mac-goodwin-windproof">here</a></p>

    <p>I built this website myself, coded in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. You can view the code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/mac-goodwin.com">here</a>, as well as my <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry?tab=repositories">other projects</a></p>
