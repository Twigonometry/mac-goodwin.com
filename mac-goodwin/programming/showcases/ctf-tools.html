<h3>CTF Tools</h3>

<p>This repository contains a suite of tools I have built in an attempt to understand common tools such as port scanners, repeaters, and password crackers - see it on Github <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/CTF-Tools">here</a></p>

<p>It is a constant work in progress - as you can see by the <a href="https://github.com/Twigonometry/CTF-Tools/projects">issues board</a>!</p>

<p>I also intend to use these tools as a teaching resource for Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers Society - automation is a fundamental tool, so this repo will hopefully show some useful examples of how to apply these skills to CTFs and boxes</p>
