    <h2>Writing</h2>
</div>

<p>I've loved writing since I was a little kid, and have recently starting producing things that people other than my parents like to read</p>

<p>I am a fan of writing poetry with a touch of the surreal, preferring to tackle topics such as grief, anxiety, and my experiences living alongside OCD. But I also like to dabble in Lovecraftian horror, dystopian fiction, and stories about feverish nightmares and otherworldly horrors. Occasionally, these areas collide</p>

<p>My work has been featured in several online literary magazines. In September 2020 I was delighted to be awarded first prize in the 20-30 category of Hive's <a href="/writing/hive-2020.html">Young Writers Competition</a></p>
