    <h2>Hive Young Writer's Competition 2020</h2>
</div>

<p>In September 2020 I was delighted to be declared the winner of the Young Writer's Competition 2020, in the 20-30 age category</p>

<p>You can view the full results on Hive's Website <a href="http://www.hivesouthyorkshire.com/compresults-2020">here</a>. Please go and check them out - they are a brilliant organisation who run lots of fantastic workshops for young writers based in Yorkshire (I'm a Manc, but they let me in cause I study across the peaks)</p>

<h3>My Entry</h3>

<p>I wrote <i>Terror Form</i> in February 2020, and touched it up in September before I sent it off to Hive. I was experimenting with trying to convey the feelings associated with a nightmare, after a spate of vivid dreams that I started noting down. The piece plays with memories of childhood nightmares, recent anxiety-fuelled dreams, and the fear that comes with lying in the dark in an empty house</p>

<p>Here's what Paula Rawsthorne, the Competition's judge, had to say:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"There’s much to marvel at in this beautifully written piece.  It’s laden with original, arresting images and inventive turns of phrase.  It manages to convey the feverish, anxiety-inducing, ramblings of a nightmare in captivating style."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Terror Form</i> will be published in the Hive Anthology at some point in 2021</p>
