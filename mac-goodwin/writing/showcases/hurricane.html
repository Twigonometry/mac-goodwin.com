<p>I wanted to explore the range of emotions in therapy - the tumultuous feeling when challenging your own beliefs, and the moments of peace when you feel you're making progress</p>

<hr>

<p>
    We are stalking a hurricane
    <br/>
    a great, grey, whistling beast;
    <br/>
    mouth puckered, narrowed eyes
    <br/>
    it passes over trembling houses
    <br/>
    and breathes them in.
</p>

<p>
    You have run from it
    <br/>
    taken shelter under kitchen tables
    <br/>
    pinned down the things you love;
    <br/>
    you have knelt in its path
    <br/>
    in a contorted prayer.
</p>

<p>
    But I will show you, you are safest
    <br/>
    when you dance within its eye.
</p>
