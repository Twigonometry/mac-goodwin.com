<h3>Mycelium</h3>

<h4>Published on 01 - 11 - 2020</h4>

<p><i>Mycelium</i> was first published in Green Ink Poetry's brilliant <a href="https://www.greeninkpoetry.co.uk/poetry-collections/safe-guard-part-one">Safeguard Collection (Part One)</a></p>

<p>I'd never attempted to write in an imagist or micro-poetry style before this poem, so the constraints of the collection were great fun to try and work within!</p>

<p>
    Ash white you roll
    <br/>
    Over deep reds
    <br/>
    And mottled greens
    <br/>
    Of neglected chillis
</p>
<p>
    A strange beauty
    <br/>
    Webbed fingers
    <br/>
    Stretching out
    <br/>
    For life
</p>
<p>
    You creep into
    <br/>
    The corners
    <br/>
    I am just too tired
    <br/>
    To clean
</p>
