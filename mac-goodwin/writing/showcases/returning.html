<p style="text-align:right;">
    Sun has fallen
    <br/>
    Lonely road
    <br/>
    In the distance
    <br/>
    Tyres groan
    <br/>
    Sunset tarmac
    <br/>
    Hot plastic loam
    <br/>
    Molten, scattered
    <br/>
    Coats the road
    <br/>
    Scoop the liquid
    <br/>
    Bring it home
</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">
    Crossing over
    <br/>
    Look both ways
    <br/>
    Bloody hands
    <br/>
    That lift away
    <br/>
    Blackened fragments
    <br/>
    Soaked in rain
    <br/>
    Close your eyes
    <br/>
    And breathe again
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Scattered pieces
    <br/>
    Scan the road
    <br/>
    Cross and collect
    <br/>
    Dead plastic shards
    <br/>
    Brittle broken
    <br/>
    Ballooning open
    <br/>
    Piece together
    <br/>
    Not that hard
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Whiplash memory
    <br/>
    Familiar tones
    <br/>
    Rocking head split
    <br/>
    On the stone
    <br/>
    Rebounding thoughts
    <br/>
    Never depart
    <br/>
    Think you saw them
    <br/>
    At the start
</p>
<p>
    Last night returns
    <br/>
    In cheerless tolls
    <br/>
    Ringing bleakly
    <br/>
    Grey overtones
    <br/>
    Morning breaks
    <br/>
    A pulsing phone
    <br/>
    Brightest lights
    <br/>
    But nothing shown
</p>
<p>
    Streams of blue light
    <br/>
    Draining rays
    <br/>
    A searchlight pulses
    <br/>
    Through the haze
    <br/>
    Inviting you
    <br/>
    To try again
    <br/>
    With new direction
    <br/>
    You stumble home
    <br/>
    Understand this
    <br/>
    Make it known
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Torn up signposts
    <br/>
    Smashed apart
    <br/>
    All ignored by
    <br/>
    Passing cars
    <br/>
    Sheared from metal
    <br/>
    Hills ahead
    <br/>
    Slow it down, now
    <br/>
    In your head
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    hundred senses beating heart tap your fingers senseless dread
    <br/>
    scattered paper it’s an art think you’ve been here since the start
    <br/>
    there is a way out don’t come apart just remember what she said
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Losing track
    <br/>
    You miss a beat
    <br/>
    Broken nails
    <br/>
    Blistered feet
    <br/>
    Scream in silence
    <br/>
    Sweet release
    <br/>
    Furious scrawling
    <br/>
    Hard to beat
</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">
    Lonely winter
    <br/>
    No reprise
    <br/>
    Stood here watching
    <br/>
    Cars go by
    <br/>
    No one stops
    <br/>
    To catch your eye
    <br/>
    Can’t flag them down
    <br/>
    Not that you tried
</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">
    Pay attention
    <br/>
    Ups and downs
    <br/>
    Screaming rubber
    <br/>
    Tears through town
    <br/>
    Rushing buildings
    <br/>
    Tumble down
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Just in earshot
    <br/>
    Piercing wail
    <br/>
    Frantic blue lights
    <br/>
    Leave a trail
    <br/>
    You realise, now
    <br/>
    That you have failed
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    pulling over to the side returning there you read the signs
    <br/>
    twisting maps to guide you home understand it make it known
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    For tougher times
    <br/>
    You must prepare
    <br/>
    Waiting here
    <br/>
    To be repaired
    <br/>
    Stick a thumb out
    <br/>
    Are you scared?
    <br/>
    To go back to
    <br/>
    Those comfy chairs
</p>
<p>
    Plateau pictures
    <br/>
    Swooping lines
    <br/>
    Vibrant posters
    <br/>
    In dismal times
    <br/>
    Glued together
    <br/>
    Map your mind
    <br/>
    Within the ink
    <br/>
    Some good to find
</p>
<p>
    You admit
    <br/>
    You lost your way
    <br/>
    It must be hard
    <br/>
    To come today
    <br/>
    Cast it back
    <br/>
    What did she say?
    <br/>
    Reach out before
    <br/>
    You suffocate
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Growling engine
    <br/>
    On the run
    <br/>
    Grinding metal
    <br/>
    Smash head on
    <br/>
    By steel hands
    <br/>
    To cold air flung
    <br/>
    Icy water
    <br/>
    Fills your lungs
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    Blue search party
    <br/>
    Hope and pray
    <br/>
    He deserved
    <br/>
    Just one more day
    <br/>
    Screeching sirens
    <br/>
    Cars give way
    <br/>
    Reflecting from
    <br/>
    The gaping lake
    <br/>
    Pull you out
    <br/>
    Before you drown
    <br/>
    Lift you up
    <br/>
    And lay you down
</p>
<p>
    Remember how far
    <br/>
    You have come
    <br/>
    Chest is tight
    <br/>
    Your seatbelt on
    <br/>
    You had it once
    <br/>
    But now it’s gone
    <br/>
    It’s just your headlights
    <br/>
    Coming on
</p>
<p>
    Returning now
    <br/>
    We take it slow
    <br/>
    Searchlights swooping
    <br/>
    Down the road
    <br/>
    You understood it
    <br/>
    Made it known
    <br/>
    Now you’re on
    <br/>
    The long road home
</p>
