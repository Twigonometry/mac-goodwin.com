<h3>Silverfish</h3>

<h4>Published on 08 - 06 - 2021</h4>

<p><i>Silverfish</i> was first published on <a href="https://twitter.com/mac__goodwin/status/1402189182609526791">my twitter</a></p>

<p>It was inspired by a recent experience with them in our home and a resurgence of obsessive germophobic thoughts. I wanted to continue my experiments with erratic form to convey this.</p>

<p>I've still not found a proper home for this poem, but I'm sure I will!</p>

<div class="writing-showcase-content">
<p>
    are nocturnal creatures
    <br/>
evil			they scuttle along the brittle spines of kitchen tiles
<br/>
</p>

<p>
this means you may only meet them
<br/>
    by chance;	when you least expect it, perhaps
    <br/>
    searching for water	in the dead of night
    <br/>
    risen from safe, weary sheets		on comes the light
    <br/>
                    your hand graces antenna
                    <br/>
                    your eyes drink in
                    <br/>
</p>

<p>
disgust		you can feel them all over your body
<br/>
the sight of them	escaping into   unknown cracks
<br/>
    you know there might		be hundreds   rustling in the walls
    <br/>
    you have googled it	     a thousand tiny, serrated feet
    <br/>
    antennas twitching         slinking bodies	   searching for something
    <br/>
</p>

<p>
rotten				you are becoming dust		for them
<br/>
to eat		something starchy, perhaps
<br/>
    your favourite books	the foundations of your house
    <br/>
    bullet holes	peppering	your clothes
    <br/>
    and you fear		that you cannot control
    <br/>
</p>

<p>
such growth 	in such a terrible place		millions of scaly bodies		you can feel
<br/>
them while you sleep		in rolling sweat     and wake
<br/>
    to find them tangled in your sheets
    <br/>
    you know that nothing is safe	  from their grey, scraping teeth
    <br/>
    you have googled it			   you have witnessed it
    <br/>
    you know their might
    <br/>
</p>

<p>
    oh, and now		    you must clean yourself
    <br/>
    and the counters	   in between the cracks
    <br/>
    the bathroom floor	 the insides of the walls
    <br/>
    you must sweep          anything that they have touched
    <br/>
    and excavate	    all the crevices of this terrifying earth
</p>
