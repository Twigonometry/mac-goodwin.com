        before       there were fast things
        <br/>
                                bright    circling    things
        <br/>
                        distractions to     retreat     into
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        life chugged along
        <br/>
        <br/>
                                you    took    trains        with the one you love
        <br/>
                                      watched the rapid     retreat     of thoughts through the window
        <br/>
                                        swept up      in the tunnels   and wind
        <br/>
                                and you chugged    distracting    liquids with friends
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        you worked
        <br/>
                            often   choked   by the speed of   approach
        <br/>
                        but it was normal
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        you received therapy
        <br/>
                           a gift, wrapped in cardboard and      posted   second class
        <br/>
                        but when it arrived it was beautiful
        <br/>
                                bright white and     spacious
        <br/>
                                        revealing
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        you took deep, agonising breaths    full    of   it
        <br/>
                                holding them in
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        then            there was panic
        <br/>
        <br/>
                a   sudden   breathless rush
        <br/>
                        coming in from  the   cold;    a ruthless, aching wind
        <br/>
                before  all   life    slowed      down
        <br/>
        <br/>
                 trains    passed    through         empty stations
        <br/>
                         pasta briefly   graced   empty shelves
        <br/>
                   beds emptied      and refilled
        <br/>
        <br/>
                there were some fast goodbyes
        <br/>
        <br/>
                  and then    you were home
        <br/>
                      surrounded and  thawing  but somehow alone
        <br/>
                therapy came  crackling     and   broken   by   static     down the phone
        <br/>
                        work arrived  in    spluttering    bursts;   and then it    flowed
        <br/>
        <br/>
                   and there was no   time   to     think
        <br/>
                        no time     to breathe   or    seek         a safer  place   inside
        <br/>
                      but you did not   mourn    these things   â€“   they had barely crossed your mind
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        now           there is some pause
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        a        slowing down of sorts
        <br/>
                           as life begins   to    open     up
        <br/>
                                albeit        at a   changing speed
        <br/>
        <br/>
                         the flow of work    splutters    almost to a    halt
        <br/>
                                a trickle
        <br/>
                           and you can   breathe   just for a moment
        <br/>
        <br/>
                but in the   freshness   of     this breath
        <br/>
                                there is a   sour note
        <br/>
                        a sense of    older problems    creeping in
        <br/>
                                now they have been awarded    space    to   swell   and    bloat
        <br/>
                                        to regain old   hard-fought    ground
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
                                and still, there are   no    swooping    trains   to be   whisked away   by
        <br/>
                                        no touch to be    taken over    and consumed by
        <br/>
                                not even the familiar    rush of cool air    to be   renewed    by
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        you do not know    what to do    with these sprawling empty days
        <br/>
                                but this   painful part   of you does; it    rushes in    with anxious thought
        <br/>
                                        to fill the space in between
        <br/>
                                and   pull you   to the very edges of the room       squealing   and   taut
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        therapy salvages    some clarity again
        <br/>
                                        in terrifying painful truths it says
        <br/>
                                you must   reclaim   the air it swallows every day
        <br/>
                                and   step into   the space  instead
        <br/>
        <br/>
                        you must   reframe    the time it takes
        <br/>
                                        not as some     sorry stolen thing
        <br/>
                                     but as an opportunity to bring
        <br/>
                                                your fullest self to the fight
        <br/>
        
        <br/>
                                        an opportunity
        <br/>
                                                to     stretch     yourself out    -    astonished,   and renewed
        <br/>
                                        and   extend   into    the light
