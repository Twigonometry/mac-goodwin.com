<h3>Therapy is</h3>

<h4>Published on 10 - 06 - 2021</h4>

<p><i>Therapy is</i> was first published in Green Ink Poetry's wonderful <a href="https://www.greeninkpoetry.co.uk/poetry-collections/discovery">Discovery collection</a></p>

<p>The collection asked to explore both physical places and people; I wanted to write about both in this poem, so included some natural imagery that I thought felt evocative</p>

<div class="writing-showcase-content">
<p>
    cavernous	within it	still pools of cool blue water
    <br/>
		you might find	within it	pools of shimmering stalactites
        <br/>
		within it	many pools	   of shimmering terrible water
        <br/>
a cavern	its roof is high and shimmering	with shivering stalactites
<br/>
		and you might find	within it	watery teardrop stalactites
        <br/>
			that shimmer		in the deep
            <br/>
</p>

<p>
cavernous	you are pushed		against its roof	its wet stone	you suffocate
<br/>
expansive	a great frozen Scandinavian lake	under dancing lights	and mile-high pine
<br/>
freezing		you are standing	in the middle of it all	trying to stay on your feet
<br/>
		you are standing	in the middle	of a mile-high pine
        <br/>
			and you are dripping	with shimmering stalactites
            <br/>
frozen		there are stalactites		sprouting from your feet
<br/>
</p>

<p>
hard to reach	you have shivered	just to get here
<br/>
hard to see	you have travelled		many thousands of miles
<br/>
		you have climbed	stalactite pines	scrambled upon
        <br/>
						wet stalactite stone
                        <br/>
</p>

<p>
hard to reach	you have climbed	with frozen feet
<br/>
		you are cavernous	you are travelling
        <br/>
		you are deep
        <br/>
		you are		a cavernous shimmering stalactite
        <br/>
					you are pushed under skin	you are sliding deep
                    <br/>
		you are a frozen, shimmering lake
        <br/>
		within you	you might find
        <br/>
			that you are becoming	hard to reach
