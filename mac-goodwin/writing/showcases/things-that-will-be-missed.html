<h3>Things that will be missed this winter</h3>

<h4>Written on 15 - 11 - 20 --- Published here on 04 - 01 - 21</h4>

<p><i>Things that will be missed</i> is another imagist/micropoem with a focus on the things I remember fondly about winter; ranging from walks as a kid, to exploring the Manchester markets as a teenager</p>

<p>I wanted to focus on things that protect you, like the safety of your own home - not just from the cold, but from the Coronavirus pandemic that made Christmas 2020 so different</p>

<p>
    Elbows touching at the kitchen table, shirt cuffs dragged through gravy;
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legs crossing on the floor, new socks brushing on the soft fireside carpet
</p>
<p>
    The drive home, fog on the windscreen, headlights splintering like ancient pine
	<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onto your sleeping lap; a wreath waiting on the door, light spilling from the porch
</p>
<p>
    Polystyrene bowls of hot garlic potatoes, skewered by a spindly wooden fork;
	<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bodies touching shoulders, butter dribbling from chins onto colourful scarves
</p>
<p>
    Rambling riverside walks and the family dog, brindle spotted with flecks of white;
	<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brittle clothes peeled off in a creaking hallway, draped on the banister to dry
</p>
<p>
    Drawn curtains and a weary sofa, plates of homemade mince pies; the comfort of knowing – 
	<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite rapidly darkening skies – that you will all be together in time
</p>
