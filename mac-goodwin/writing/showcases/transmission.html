    <p>
        We have left each other
        <br/>
        With far more than two metres of space
        <br/>
        Tethered together only by the transmission
        <br/>
        Of a stream of lonely bytes
        <br/>
        And this is the most distant we have been
        <br/>
        Floating in an air-gapped embrace
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have left you
        <br/>
        Anxious to get back home
        <br/>
        To be cooked for and enveloped, but knowing
        <br/>
        How it would crush you to do the same
        <br/>
        And this is the most broken you have been
        <br/>
        Anxious to not be alone
        <br/>
        But I can still see you
        <br/>
        From this great distance; like a beam of light
        <br/>
        Striking a mirror on the moon
        <br/>
        My symptoms are beamed up, reflected
        <br/>
        And projected onto you
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have seen this before
        <br/>
        And, in the midst of this crisis, I have seen it in you
        <br/>
        You have contracted this great, shared pain
        <br/>
        Transmitted in droplets between those we love
        <br/>
        Leaving you broken, bedridden; it comes in waves
        <br/>
        And, in our efforts to isolate, it has washed over you
        <br/>
        You are far away, and plummeting
        <br/>
        Depression is contagious, too
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Separate, we are spiralling
        <br/>
        Not close enough to grasp your hands
        <br/>
        And pull; some days, these fumbled efforts
        <br/>
        Just send you spinning further
        <br/>
        And I know I cannot catch you like you did for me
        <br/>
        When I was at my worst; how you scooped me up
        <br/>
        And shook me, guiding me back to you
        <br/>
        I want to show you how I fought this, over time
        <br/>
        But this is not my race; I must let you run it
        <br/>
        And Iâ€™ll stand waiting behind ribbons
        <br/>
        To hold you when you cross the line
    </p>
