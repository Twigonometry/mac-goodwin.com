<h3>Two Years</h3>

<p>
    His anniversary sneaks up on you
    <br/>
    Despite the heavy steps grief takes
    <br/>
    Irregularly placed, but making sure
    <br/>
    You cannot forget the day
</p>
<p>
    But somehow, you did not expect
    <br/>
    That feeling to arrive this way
    <br/>
    In photos of that sprawling blue
    <br/>
    Tainted by a painful grey
</p>
<p>
    And carried by such mournful words
    <br/>
    Heard first two years ago
    <br/>
    When, uniformed and stunned, you stood
    <br/>
    As he was carried in and stowed
</p>
<p>
    And those words return to you today
    <br/>
    Spoken from a clifftop in the sun
    <br/>
    To bring comfort to the ones who lost
    <br/>
    A brother, friend, and son
</p>
