<p><i>Windproof</i> was first published in the second part of Green Ink Poetry's <a href="https://www.greeninkpoetry.co.uk/poetry-collections/safe-guard-part-two">Safeguard Collection</a> (they picked a fantastic photo, as always)</p>

<p>It explores the simple comfort of a brand new coat in a downpour - but it also lightly explores reconnecting to nature, and how powerful the outdoors can be when learning to live alongside your mental health issues</p>

    You picked out the coat yourself – the first you remember, baggy and black,
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entirely your own – with only a little help from your dad
    <br/>
    and it was with you on that first ascent, cradling your skinny frame
    <br/>
    and stood with you against godless torrents of rain; dark, midday skies
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a slippery, unfamiliar ridge; and a solemn retreat to the car
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where you wrung cold rain from the jacket’s wilted seams
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    That was a time, before all this
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you could feel the ground beneath your feet
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shifting of the stones that pave the ancient hilltop streets
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watch the way he stepped and how his feet would land
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and follow, to the top, without a map in hand
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    It is time for a new coat, now – sleek, and bright shimmering blue
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wind-tested cocoon; this time, the mountain is yours
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next time, your mind may be your own
</p>
